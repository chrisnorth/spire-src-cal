Source Calibration code and example scripts for SPIRE

***This respository is for development purposes only***

For _official_ releases of code and products, please see official SPIRE websites and documents, such as:
 + [The SPIRE calibration Web](http://herschel.esac.esa.int/twiki/bin/view/Public/SpireCalibrationWeb)
 + [The SPIRE Handbook](http://herschel.esac.esa.int/Docs/SPIRE/spire_handbook.pdf)
 + [SPIRE Photometer Beam Analysis pages](http://herschel.esac.esa.int/twiki/bin/view/Public/SpirePhotometerBeamProfileAnalysis)
 + [The HIPE online help pages](http://herschel.esac.esa.int/hcss-doc-12.0/)

Description
-----------
Currently all scripts are in Jython for use in HIPE, but it is expected that
in the future scripts in additional languages will be added.
